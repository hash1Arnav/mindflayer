Steps for implementation in Python3. Replace with corresponding libraries, syntax and commands.


import following libraries:
  opencv, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, keras, tensorflow
  
create age groups: 16-25, 25-45, 45-60, 60+
  
take continuous heart rate input from ppg sensor store
log values in a database
  
take continuous inputs from gsr sensors store
log values in a database
 
take continuous inputs from SpO2 sensor
log values in a database 

take continuous inputs from breath rate sensor
log values in a database 
  
measure stress level by using gsr, temperature, breathing rate values
log values

if camera available, use opencv to scan
store data

Align assimilated data into stacks of individual people. 

Ask people or record their mood

Create training data set based on determined emotions

Create chatbot with inputs

Record responses from people with pre-determined emotions

Filter keywords and store as another data set based on emotions. Assign words to different emotions (can overlap)

Compile and align both datasets together. Use them independedently to reaffirm emotions

import pyttsx3 for text-to-speech api

design chatbot response system to convert chatbot into 2 types:
  a) chatbot
  b) voice assistant
